# Wine-Prediction-Analysis
# Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to evaluate and compare classification and clustering models on a wine dataset from the UCI dataset library. The focus is on predicting wine quality based on various parameters and understanding the major differences among wine types.

## Contributors
- Sadiya Amreen

## Data
The dataset consists of 16 parameters measured for 178 wine samples from three different cultivars in Italy.

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, normalization, and type conversion.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and K-Means Clustering.
- **Visualization and Analysis:** Using ggplot2 in R for data visualization.

## Key Findings
- High accuracy in wine type prediction using KNN and Decision Tree models.
- Effective grouping and distinction of wine types using K-Means Clustering.

## How to Run
- R environment setup: Instructions for setting up the R environment to run the analysis.
- Data loading: Steps to load and preprocess the data.
- Model training and evaluation: Guidelines to train and evaluate the machine learning models.

## Repository Structure
- `/data`: Dataset used in the project.
- `/scripts`: R scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `/visualizations`: Visualizations generated from the analysis.
